### Tech Stack
* Python 3
* Tkinter for GUI
* pycryptodomex for Cryptodome
* RC4 Encryption

### External Dependencies
* `pycryptodomex` for RC4 encryption.
```sh
pip install pycryptodomex
```

### How to Encrypt/Decrypt
1. Run the script and click on SELECT FILES to select any file (preferably .txt file to encrypt and .rc4 to decrypt)
2. If input is text than empty the file directory column 
3. Input the key for encryption and decryption
4. Choose ENCRYPT to execute encryption process and DECRYPT for decryption process
5. For text decryption from ciphertext, copy the ciphertext generated from encryption process and copy paste to Enter text column then input key and click DECRYPT
5. To reset all input variables, click RESET button
